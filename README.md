# Overview

Throughout the semester, we've looked at how surveillance technologies are constructed and deployed in ways that often work to reinforce and perpetuate racial hierarchies. Some of the authors we've read use the concepts of visibility and risk to frame how technologies that can seem invisible or harmless to dominant groups can have very different impacts on minoritized communities.

The goal for this lab is to think about how surveillance and race show up in our own engagement and interaction with technology.

There are multiple options for how you could approach or complete this lab.

The lab notebook consists of a narrative that documents and describes your experience working through this lab. Each prompt has some reflection questions to consider as a starting place.

If working collaboratively, the notebook should include comments from each member of the group. These can be combined in a single notebook or submitted individually along with work completed collaboratively.

Questions to consider as a starting place:
- What are some of your initial observations from this experience?
- What stood out in your exploration of the data?
- Anything that surprised or concerned you?
- How are you thinking about race and surveillance differently after this experience?
  * Connections with previous class content/discussion
- Other comments/questions/etc

# Option #1: Data Tracking Log

Keep a log this week tracking how and where you appear in surveillance technology systems.

This could range from using apps that include location tracking, posting on social media, completing the daily health check, or using your student ID card to access a building/space/resource.

[Link to sample log Google Form (ND users)](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aAm70RY5DxJicoFzcNKSwSCyuLvlKUGYgKIANmsoV70/edit?usp=sharing). Folks can make a copy and customize as needed.

- Folks are also welcome to explore this data in Python, RStudio, etc.

Discussion/reflection questions:
- What are some of your initial observations from the experience of logging data?
- What stood out in your exploration of the data?
- Anything that surprised or concerned you?
- How are you thinking about race and surveillance differently after this experience?
- Other comments/questions/etc

# Option #2: Environmental Scan

Identify a couple of commonly-used campus spaces or a community public space. Run your own version of EFF's "Spot the Surveillance."

What kinds of tracking or surveillance technologies are you able to see when in the space?

What background information are you able to gather about what technologies are being used?

Discussion/reflection questions:
- What are some of your initial observations from this experience?
- What stood out in your exploration of the data?
- Anything that surprised or concerned you?
- How are you thinking about race and surveillance differently after this experience?
- Other comments/questions/etc

# Option #3: Social Media Data Download

Download your data from a social media platform that you use frequently.
